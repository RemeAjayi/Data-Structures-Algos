    "Heaps are a special type of binary tree. A complete binary tree has the leaves on every level filled. An almost complete binary tree is filled from left to right and leaves should be present only at the last and 2nd leaf. A complete tree is a perfect binary tree or an almost complete binary tree. We have min heaps and max heaps. A max heap has the maximum element at the root node and same goes for sub trees. A min-heap is a complete binary tree in which the root is always the minimum and same goes for all sub trees. Other special heaps fibonacci, binomial and leftist heaps. \n",
